# grails-kml-map-plugin
A plugin to read raw kml file in - load google maps and overlay kml boundaries over map geo locations, international postcode lookup &amp; resolve address from postcode feature



I will be putting together existing work that never went live for another project, the plugin will cover parsing of a huge KML file, or smaller specific files, split into the boundaries provided. 

It will provide a live KML editor as part of the plugin, to update existing KML files meaning you can redesign a given area let's say London or even more detailed, `Islington` a borough within London, and redraw those boundaries to be smaller or bigger.

Once set, the postcode resolving system that will also be provided will resolve a given postcode and using google provide the end address upto it's door number. Tested internationally and worked fine.

The user's actual boundary will also be defined based on a calculation of where they sit in the boundary of your KML file, ie provide the borough or boundary name they reside in.


Its a lot of work I need to strip out and put together, will keep me busy in the evenings for next few months

Watch this space I guess..
